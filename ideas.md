## Generating knowledge bases from observations

Currently, state-of-the-art work in commonsense reasoning relies on using knowledge bases to understand how the world works.
These knowledge bases are typically manually created, but it is not feasible to manually create a knowledge base which explains the entire universe.
There are knowledge bases which are automatically generated in a manner which can be scaled without significant human effort, but they are not as robust as desired.
For example, Ascent++ was generated procedurally from the C4 corpus, and there has been work done in generating knowledge bases from LLMs.
Although these works have advanced the state of the art, they do not scale as well as we would like.

Maybe I can spend my thesis advancing towards this direction: generating knowledge bases procedurally without human toil.
One possible direction is to let a machine intelligence interact with the real world through a robot.
As it interacts with the world, it takes observations, slowly generating information about the world.
This is, roughly speaking, how human children learn how the world works.
This plan is very preliminary and would need further refinement, but it might be a useful starting point.
