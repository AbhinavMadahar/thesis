## Navigating this repository

This repository has four major directories.
The first is the `thesis` directory, which contains my thesis document.
The second is the `experiments` directory, which contains the code I used to run experiments along with the data I collected from this.
The third is the `ideas` directory, where I add potential ideas for new research directions.
The fourth is the `proposals` directory, which contains my thesis proposal.

## How to use this repository

Please consult this table to match your desire with the appropriate directory:

| Desire                                | Directory     |
|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| Read my thesis                        | `thesis`      |
| Re-run my experiments or view my data | `experiments` |
| Verify my data analyses               | `analyses`    |
| Check out my research ideas           | `ideas`       |
| Read my thesis proposal               | `proposal`    |

My thesis is written in LuaLaTex and must be built with a compiler which supports it; if you try to build my thesis with `pdflatex`, then it will fail.
The code which runs my thesis is written in Python 3, and I use PyTorch.
Data is stored in JSON.
