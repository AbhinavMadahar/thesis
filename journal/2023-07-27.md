- [x] read chapter 3 of (Colon-Hernandez, 2023)
- [ ] find material on prompting LLMs

---

Section 3.2 was a broad survey of previous work on data-to-text generation with planning.
I did not understand some things which were said, but I am not very concerned about this because the rest of the thesis does not depend on it.
It again mentioned prompting; I think that I should learn more about prompting LLMs at some point.

Section 3.3 went over other related techniques.
It was nice to have an idea of recent work, but I was not very interested in the particular techniques detailed.
I noted that the final work mentioned, GRILLBot, was published in late 2022, only a few months before this thesis was published.
It's nice to see that there is active work in this field.
