## Thesis proposal

I continued on (Kim et al, 2022).

I think that I can finish the content by mid-October, assuming that I do two or three papers a day.
After that, I will need two or three weeks to draft the proposal, so I expect to finish in early November, giving me a comfortable margin until the first deadline, December 1.

This is mind-numbingly dull.
