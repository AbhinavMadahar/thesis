## Navigating this repository

This repository has three major directories.
The first is the `thesis` directory, which contains my thesis document.
The second is the `experiments` directory, which contains the code I used to run experiments along with the data I collected from this.
The third is the `proposals` directory, which contains my thesis proposal.

## How to use this repository

If you just want to read my thesis, then just open the file `thesis/thesis.pdf`.
If you want to re-run my experiments or view my data, then open the appropriate directory in `experiments`.
My code is licensed under the MIT License.

My thesis is written in XeLaTex and must be built with a compiler which supports it; if you try to build my thesis with `pdflatex`, then it will fail.
The code which runs my thesis is written in Python 3, and I use PyTorch.
Data is stored in JSON.
