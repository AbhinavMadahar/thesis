# Changelog

The first table refers to how many words are in the current estimated word count of the outline.
The '[e]stimated' component refers to the uncertainty in the current estimated word count from the top of this document, not from any uncertainty in this table.
The second refers to how many words are in the thesis document itself, the 'boomer' version specifically.
Note that it begins at 469 because that's how many words were in the document on 2024-09-12, mostly just chapter headings, frontmatter, etc.
I do not distinguish between body content and, for lack of a better term, auxiliary content.
