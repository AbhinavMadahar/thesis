# Thesis Proposal Plan

This document organises the work I need to do to complete my thesis proposal.
I want to submit my thesis proposal as part of my doctoral application.
The earliest deadline is Dec 1, so I need to finish the thesis proposal by then, at lease to an extent sufficient to demonstrate to the universities that I can complete a strong thesis at their institution.

My thesis proposal will identify on which subfields of conversational agents I will focus.
I need to say that I will further research on XYZ topic, but I do not need to specify how I will do so; that question will be answered at a later stage.

## Todo

- [x] Outline a plan via a todo list
- [x] Decide topic
- [ ] Run a literature review on commonsense reasoning
	- [x] Find some survey papers in the field
	- [ ] Read those survey papers, taking notes (TODO: identify what to note)
	- [ ] Read papers referenced by those papers
	- [ ] Recur the previous step until you cannot find any more papers published within the last three years (fixed at January 1, 2020 onwards)
- [ ] Identify major subfields. For each subfield, identify
	- [ ] goals,
	- [ ] prior work,
	- [ ] current work, and
	- [ ] future directions
- [ ] Decide which subfields to focus on for my thesis
- [ ] Outline potential ways to further research in each subfield
- [ ] Draft the thesis proposal
	- [ ] Rough draft the content
	- [ ] Format it appropriately (using the Columbia LaTeX template)
	- [ ] Proofread
