# Thesis Outline

Goal word count: 100 000

## Outline

- Introduction
  - Explain that I am dropping the downstream tasks section originally planned in my proposal because AGI is a stronger problem [100 words]
  - Note that this is a substantial undertaking and explain why [200 words]
    - Note that this involves substantial interdisciplinary work, incorporating, among other fields, economics, philosophy, and jurisprudence into the core computer scientific and cognitive scientific work
      - Make a joke about having a long acknowledgments section
    - Note that GPT-4o views this as an ambitious undertaking but also views me as being capable
    - Make a joke about how my current dissertation advisor is GPT-4o and that you can become my new one by accepting my graduate school application
  - Motivation
    - I'll need to explain the relevance of each section
    - History
    - Cognitive science section
    - Computer science section
    - Ethics section
  - Explain that, alongside my research, I intend to influence public policy [200 words]
    - Policy should be informed by expert scientific opinion
    - ...
    - Yann LeCun's Twitter feed
  - Note that, because of time constraints, my methodology sections are underdeveloped [100 words]
- History
  - Why is it probative during policy decision-making to historicize the debate on artificial intelligence, especially artificial general intelligence and artificial general superintelligence? [200 words]
- What are intelligence and consciousness?
  - Methodoloy
    - Note that I take inspiration from (Andreas, 2022) [40 words]
  - Note that machine intelligence need not replicate natural intelligence [200 words]
    - > For example, with a better understanding of when (and how) communicative intentions are encoded in LMs, producing goal directed
      > language would require only translating an agent’s (extrinsic) goals into a trained LM’s (intrinsic) intention representation
      > scheme. While this hybrid training paradigm has no obvious analog in evolution or human language acquisition, it might be the only
      > path to research on high-quality language modeling compatible with human timescales (Andreas, 2022)
  - Viability of behaviourial lens
    - Consider the following question: if a system can ...
- Advancing commonsense reasoning capabilities
  - Focusing on chained commonsense reasoning
    - Note that I began considering chained commonsense reasoning in December 2023, using my tweet and email to Prof. 최 as proof [300 words]
      - Explain that I was introduced to chained reasoning by the tweet
      - Explain the idea of latent chain-of-thought reasoning as detailed by the tweet
      - I initially planned to apply chained reasoning, more specifically latent chained reasoning, to commonsense knowledge graphs
      - However, I later came to the conclusion that it seemed more fruitful to apply this to language-model-based commonsense reasoning techniques
        - Explain that this is because there is an argument that only natural language is able to capture the full breadth of human thought
        - Note that human thought is not necessarily the only useful mechanism by which thought is achievable, indeed it may not even be the optimal
    - Note that OpenAI in September 2024 released their new language model, o1, the result of AKA Project Strawberry, a project which attempts to incorporate commonsense reasoning, especially chained commonsense reasoning, into OpenAI's GPT model line [100 words]
    - Note that this is the first time that my ongoing research has directly paralleled another lab's, and note that it's a strong bull signal that that lab is none of than OpenAI itself [100 words]
      - Add that PhD comic about when another lab publishes the idea on which you were working
- Ethical matters
  - Alignment
    - Introduce the question of whether methods which ensure alignment necessarily ensure superalignment [100 words]
  - Effective accelerationism
  - Ethical downsides
    - Acute or short-term concerns
    - Chronic or long-term concerns
  - Ethical upsides
    - Integrate this with prosocial behaviour [100 words]
    - Build on my proposal's argument that artificial general intelligence would lead to a change in economy and that artificial general superintelligence may lead to a qualitatively-more-substantial change
    - Post-scarcity [800 words]
      - Super-post-scarcity
  - Protecting an artificial consciousness
    - Reference Yale Law Journal essay [80 words]
- Conclusion
- Appendices

# Changelog

The first table refers to how many words are in the current estimated word count of the outline.
The '[e]stimated' component refers to the uncertainty in the current estimated word count from the top of this document, not from any uncertainty in this table.
The second refers to how many words are in the thesis document itself, the 'boomer' version specifically.
Note that it begins at 469 because that's how many words were in the document on 2024-09-12, mostly just chapter headings, frontmatter, etc.
I do not distinguish between body content and, for lack of a better term, auxiliary content.
