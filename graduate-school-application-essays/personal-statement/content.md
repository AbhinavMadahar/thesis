TODO: note that I say 'India' instead of 'South Asia' because caste predates the state polity divisions which exist today, obviating the need for a term which refers to the region as a whole as opposed its the largest state polity

New new outline:

- Note that I am dalit and explain what that means
  - Explain that Hinduism has four castes and that dalits are a fifth group excluded from the caste system
  - Say that I am dalit
- Explain that universities would benefit from accepting applicants from marginalized or underprivileged backgrounds, but that those communities tend to have fewer educational opportunities, making it less likely that someone from such a background would be qualified to be accepted, noting that I am an unusual exception
  - Note that universities try to centralize people and voices from marginalized communities
- Explain that university admissions inform societal expectations for where people of different groups belong and that my admission would challenge societal perceptions of where dalits belong
  - Explain that university admissions inform societal expectations for where people of different groups belong
    - The opening of university admission to women was a key step in second wave feminism, challenging the idea that women do not belong in positions of authority
  - TODO: expand
- Note that grouping applicants into groups tends to ignore intra-group diversity
  - Explain how Chief Justice John Roberts notes this in the Opinion of the Court for Students for Fair Admissions
- Explain that, during graduate school, I would be able to offer a very different perspective and background to the other students
- Explain that, after graduate school, I would offer an example to other dalits and other people of marginalized communities that it is possible to be accepted, both by universities and by society

Outline:

- ~~Note that the discourse in the US on university admissions focuses on characteristics such as race, gender, sexual orientation, class, and more, and that I would like to add a new one: caste~~
- ~~Brief explanation of the Hindu caste system~~
- Demonstrate that caste is a reality in the US, that it is unrecognized, and that I would like to use my statement to raise awareness on caste and its impacts on people like me
  - ~~Demonstration that caste is a reality in the US~~
    - ~~Social construct, not a political or legal construct, and presence of Hindu communities in the US~~
    - ~~Intergenerational heredity~~
  - Note that it is underrecognized
    - Barnard and Brown have recently added caste to their list of protected classes
    - I argue that universities should explicitly ask for caste to those applicants to whom it is applicable during the application process alongside other demographic information, such as race and gender
      - In the Opinion of the Court for _Students for Fair Admissions_, Chief Justice John Roberts noted the tendency of population grouping to ignore intra-group diversity
        - e.g. 15% Mexican vs 10% from a variety of Iberian American countries
      - There is an ocean of a difference between an incoming class of brahmins and an incoming class of dalits
      - Unless universities consider caste in the same way as they do race and gender, there will likely be a tendency to favour upper-caste applicants, which would go against the mission of increasing diversity and centralizing members of marginalized communities
- Explain that I am dalit and what that means to me and others like me
  - Brief note that dalits are the lowest caste and historically have been shun from society people
    - The term 'untouchable' refers to the idea that they were so marginalized that it was impermissible to even touch their bodies
  - Note that to be dalit is to be excluded from Indian society, a precursor to the marginalization I experienced growing up as a racialized other in American society
- Note that, as I mentioned in my statement of purpose, admission into an elite university has no financial impact on me as professors make as much as software engineers, but it would change my place in society
  - In the aftermath of Students for Fair Admissions, supporters of affirmative action have argued that it gives universities the power to change the demographics of the American elite, centralizing previously-marginalized communities and voices
  - My dalit ancestors occupied the bottom of society, subsistence farmers legally prohibited from even interacting with those of higher caste
  - To be a graduate student and then professor at an elite university would drastically change my place in society
  - It is my hope that my admission would be a beacon of hope to others of marginalized communities
    - Note example of black transfer student to Columbia who understood my allusion to Barack Obama when I asked if he had transfered from Occidental and how this is an example of the impact of how seeing people from your marginalized community find acceptance and centralization can give you hope that you will as well
- In that context, my admission would be almost therapeutic from a historic perspective, the grandson of illiterate farmers being welcomed into the heart of the American nation
- Note that it is my hope that my personal statement will raise awareness of caste and the importance of considering caste inequality in American university admissions

Old outline:

- Note that admission into an elite university means different things to different people, and consider what this means in the context of this essay
  - Using an example from the Opinion of the Court for SFFA, admission into Harvard means something very different for a farm boy from Idaho than for a well-off Boston kid
  - University admissions define where people belong in society
    - The openning of admissions to women during the second wave of feminism was brought about by a change in the notion of a woman's place in the world
    - It solified the change in the popular conception
  - Note that, unlike most graduate students in computer science, I am a domestic student, so I have a different relationship with America than most of my classmates
  - My essay examines what admission into an elite university would mean for me and how that interplays with universities' missions of centralizing previously-marginalized communities, redefining what it means to be American, and setting societal expectations for people based on their race and caste
- Identify what admission into an elite university means along the axis of centralization-marginalization
  - What is the axis of centralization-marginalization?
    - We can consider the positions individuals have in society
    - Some occupy marginal positions while others are at the centre
  - How does this differ from economic class?
    - Economic class is dictated by your financial status
    - Centralization-marginalization is dictated by your place in society
    - It is possible to be economically high-class and socially marginalized and _vice versa_
  - In what ways are people centralized or marginalized?
    - In the US, the primary axes are race and class
    - In India, the primary axes are caste and religious group
  - How does admission into elite universities interplay with centralization-marginalization?
    - American society is structured such that organizations source from elite universities, whether they be Goldman Sachs or the Supreme Court
    - Admission demographics into elite universities thus dictate demographics in the American elite, in some sense deciding who is a 'true' American
    - It's an open secret that universities use their admissions process to redefine the demography of this nation's core, centralizing previously-marginalized communities and individuals
  - This means that elite universities have the ability to decide who is a 'true' American, which they can use to redefine what it means to be American
- Identify how admission into an elite university would change societal expectations for people based on their race and caste:
  - TODO: develop
- Demonstrate the ways in which my family and I have been marginalized by caste and race, and what admission would mean for me in terms of these two missions
  - Note that caste and race do not interact with international borders
    - They are social constructs, not geographical or political constructs
    - TODO: explain that caste applies to me in the US because of the social environment in which I grew up
      - My parents socialized mostly with other Indian expatriates and with family in Punjab after migrating
      - As such, I grew up in a social network dominated by Indians, providing ground for caste to apply to me
      - This was possible because there was large-scale migration from India to New Jersey; had my parents migrated to somewhere with few Indians or Balinese, then it would have been difficult for them to create a social environment where caste could apply
      - As a result of large-scale migration from India and a tendency for tribalism, caste is now a reality in the US
      - As such, American universities must now consider caste alongside other aspects such as race and gender when examining how Americans are marginalized
        - Barnard College and Brown University recently added caste to their protected categories
    - Explain the way that race applied to me living in India as a result of British imperialism
      - Open with Alexis de Tocqueville's observation that Africans in America unquestionably accepted Europeans as their superior (this is a hook)
      - As a result of British imperialism, my parents understand the world as having two halves: India and the UK, the former being inferior to the latter
      - Their self-image thus marks them as racially inferior, informing their decision to migrate to the US (they see British offshoots as interchangeable with the UK)
      - They subconsciously instilled in me the mindset that my race marks me as inferior
      - Rishi Sunak's entry into 10 Downing left an indelible mark on my father, who interpreted it as a validation of his race
      - My entry into an elite university would have the same effect, if smaller in magnitude, convincing others like me that they need not be ashamed of whom they are
      - Note the relative shortness of this understanding
        - In the discourse, we generally forget the shortness of this relationship
        - British imperialism in India only ran for around 150 years, from the late eighteenth century to the second world war
        - My own short lifetime is already one-seventh that duration; by the time I reach my life expectancy, my life's length would constitute almost the duration of the imperial period
        - Prior to that, there would be no reasonable notion of superiority; in the seventeenth century, the Mughal empire was in no way lesser than England
        - This relationship is still developing, and my admission into graduate school plays a key role in defining that relationship
  - Marginalization by caste:
    - TODO: develop
    - Story of dalits who had molten lead poured in their ears because they disobeyed their position in society (this is a hook)
    - Note that universities should consider applicants' castes (if applicable) to increase intragroup diversity
      - In the Opinion of the Court for _Students for Fair Admissions_, Chief Justice John Roberts noted the tendency of population grouping to ignore intra-group diversity
        - e.g. 15% Mexican vs 10% from a variety of Iberian American countries
      - There is an ocean of a difference between an incoming class of brahmins and an incoming class of dalits
      - Unless universities consider caste in the same way as they do race and gender, there will likely be a tendency to favour upper-caste applicants, which would go against the mission of increasing diversity
      - I argue that universities should consider applicants' castes (if applicable) to ensure caste diversity
        - Specifically, it should be included in the demographics section of the application alongside other characteristics such as gender, race, and sexual orientation
  - Marginalization and otherization by race:
    - Second grade assembly (I see your parents) (this is a hook)
    - Economic inclusion and social otherization and exclusion
      - Post-1965 immigration policy subserviant to economic policy, not to social policy
        - The idea was that foreigners would work for the US, but there was no expectation that they would be fully accepted as compatriates
        - This is encapsulated in people's refusal to drop the 'Indian-' from the 'American' when thinking of me while no equivalent 'European-' is demanded
      - South African apartheid: black and coloured South Africans participated in the economy but were shunned from society, forced to live in townships both physically and socially on the margins
    - Framing admission as social centralization gives us a means to combat communal marginalization
  - What admission would mean for me along the axis of centralization-marginalization:
    - Talk about how you toured the campi of major universities and how it felt emotionally to be in the heart of the nation after spending a lifetime on the margins
      - Joke about how the first campus you toured was Princeton and how, upon returning home, you availed yourself of a bottle of vodka which you hide from your parents and that the quantity of alcohol consumed was commensurate with the emotional significance of visiting the campus
      - You can just say that the emotions are too complex to articulate (they will understand without you needing to spoonfeed it to them)
    - Note that, at the same time as applying to graduate school, I am applying for US citizenship
    - Contrast having a US passport, basically just a piece of paper, with admission into the universities which define the nation, which would mean true membership in the nation
- Closer: say that universities are explicitly deciding where I belong and implicitly deciding where people like belong
  - Explain that anyone who knows history knows the absurdity of a dalit Indian trying to become accepted as an American
  - Explain that admission into elite universities decides where people of my caste and race belong
  - Am I an American or merely her servant?
  - Should I be ashamed of my name and my skin?
  - Do I have a place in the world or am I untouchable?
