## Thesis proposal

I continued working on (Richardson and Heck, 2023).

I realised that I probably do not need to fully read one hundred or so papers.
Doing so would constitute around one thousand pages of reading to write fifteen pages; each page of my proposal would then cover, on average, around seventy pages of reading.
That is outrageous.
I would expect each page of my proposal to reference fewer pages than that.

The Model Fune-tuning section of (Richardson and Heck, 2023) didn't have much useful information.
I'll just read the papers it cited and get the information from them, skipping (ibid).
