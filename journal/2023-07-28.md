- [ ] read sections 4.1-4.3 of (Colon-Hernandez, 2023)
- [ ] find material on prompting LLMs

---

Chapter 4 is rather large at around fifty pages, so I am only reading the first ten-or-so pages of it.

After reading section 4.1, I get the sense that this will be the first chapter to really dive deep into the thesis' novel contributions.
I need to make sure to understand exactly what is being proposed.

Section 4.2 was a slog.
It described a system which reads a story and, given a sentence, draws an inference about the world.
As an example, it gives a story about a hockey team winning a game, and the system reads the last sentence to infer that hockey teams can win games.
It does not specify _how_ the system draws this inference, only that it can take these inputs and return this output.
I expect that it will explain how it makes these inferences later.
All in all, a very challenging section to read.
