## Thesis proposal

I continued reading *Envisioning and Writing a Thesis Proposal* by Peter J.S. Franks.

He argues that a thesis proposal's literature review should be short, only covering what needs to be covered to understand the proposed work.
Unfortunately, my proposed work section is necessarily shorter than normal as a result of my not-having-attended-grad-school-yet.
To compensate, I am considering making an unusually-long literature review, demonstrating that I have a strong grasp of the field of commonsense reasoning in conversational agents.
