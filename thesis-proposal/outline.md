# Thesis Proposal Outline

This is the outline of the thesis proposal.
I do not include auxiliary sections such as the title page, abstract, and references page.

One page of text has around seven hundred words.
I expect to include some graphics in this document, but not so many that they break the one page ~= seven hundred words estimate.
One sentence is around twenty words.
This means that, for example, a single page should have around thirty-five sentences.
This makes it easy to estimate how long each section should be.

Thesis proposal total length: fifteen pages
