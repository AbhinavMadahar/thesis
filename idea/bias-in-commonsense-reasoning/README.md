# Identifying and Addressing Bias in Commonsense Reasoning

Commonsense reasoning engines may exhibit social biases (e.g. race-based, gender-based, etc.).
In this section, we try to identify whether existing models do and, if so, to what extent and how.

Specifically, we consider the following social biases:

- race-,
- gender-,
- sexual-orientation-,
- class-,
- caste-,
- religious-group-,
- national-origin-, and
- nativity-based.

If bias is found, we then try to reduce or eliminate it.
