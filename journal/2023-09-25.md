## Thesis proposal

Graduate school applications are reviewed by professors doing related work.
I am applying to almost every major university in the US, which means that my graduate school application will be read by a substantial portion of American academia in my field.
I want to capitalise on this, using my grad school application as a soap box on which I can call on the scientific community to focus more on the trunk rather than leaf of AI; that is, to focus on AGI and artificial consciousness rather than solving specific problems, such as machine translation.
My thesis will advance us in both directions, the first half working on the trunk and the second half on the leaves.
I can situate my thesis, and my graduation school application and attendance more generally, within this by (ok at this point I got too tired writing about doing science and decided to get back do actually doing it)
