## Thesis proposal

I continued adding content from (Kim et al, 2022).

While adding content, I noticed that the first three pages added around twenty lines to the outline, corresponding to around twenty sentences.
This means that each paper will give me a lot of content, so compiling the information of one hundred papers will give me a substantial proposal.
