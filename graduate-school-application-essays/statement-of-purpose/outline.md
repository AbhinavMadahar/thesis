# Statement of Purpose Outline

Scratchpad:

- Give a guide on how to evaluate my early thesis progress in the context of my application to graduate school
  - Note that all of my knowledge on commonsense reasoning has been autodidactical, so my strong understanding of the state of the field provides a substantial bull signal
    - Define bull and bear signals
    - If I've come this far without institutional support, imagine how far I could go under your tutelage

Outline:

- My research interests
- My intended advisor(s) and committee
- How my being in the aforementioned advisor(s)'s lab would strengthen both of our research
- Detail the unusual path I took to get here and how it makes it misleading to evaluate me with the standard rubric applied for a graduate school applicant
- Highlight strengths of my application
- Dispel concerns about seeming weaknesses of my application
- Explain my career plan
  - I intend to go to the Bay Area for the first five to ten years following graduate school where I would build an artificial general superintelligence alongside other computer scientists and engineers
    - Explain that I expect that an artificial general superintelligence will be built in industry
  - After that, I will return to academia as a professor
