## Thesis proposal

While going through (Kim et al, 2022), I saw some citations for other papers which might be useful for me.
This gives me more confidence in this approach; as I add papers to the proposals, those papers will give me more papers.
I can keep doing this until I have a well-fleshed-out proposal.
