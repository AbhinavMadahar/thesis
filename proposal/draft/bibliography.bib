  title         = "{HellaSwag}: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence?",
  author        = "Zellers, Rowan and Holtzman, Ari and Bisk, Yonatan and
                   Farhadi, Ali and Choi, Yejin",
  abstract      = "Recent work by Zellers et al. (2018) introduced a new task
                   of commonsense natural language inference: given an event
                   description such as ``A woman sits at a piano,'' a machine
                   must select the most likely followup: ``She sets her fingers
                   on the keys.'' With the introduction of BERT, near
                   human-level performance was reached. Does this mean that
                   machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In
                   this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves
                   difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting
                   HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are
                   trivial for humans (>95\% accuracy), state-of-the-art models
                   struggle (<48\%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering
                   (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of
                   discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of
                   machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be
                   surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the
                   length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a
                   critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated text is
                   ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by
                   state-of-the-art models. Our construction of HellaSwag, and
                   its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings
                   of deep pretrained models. More broadly, it suggests a new
                   path forward for NLP research, in which benchmarks co-evolve
                   with the evolving state-of-the-art in an adversarial way, so
                   as to present ever-harder challenges.",

                   natural language processing, but due to the sparsity of
                   training data, previous work has shown that supervised
                   methods for commonsense knowledge mining underperform when
                   evaluated on novel data. In this work, we develop a method
                   for generating commonsense knowledge using a large,
                   pre-trained bidirectional language model. By transforming
                   relational triples into masked sentences, we can use this
                   model to rank a triple's validity by the estimated pointwise
                   mutual information between the two entities. Since we do not
                   update the weights of the bidirectional model, our approach
                   is not biased by the coverage of any one commonsense

                   these models may also be storing relational knowledge

                   learned much more readily than others by standard language

                   ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without

                   Modeling the future direction of a dialogue is crucial to

              capabilities in a computer vision system dedicated to human
              action recognition. The proposed methodology is decomposed into
              two stages. First, a machine learning based algorithm -- known as
              bag of words -- gives a first estimate of action classification
              from video sequences, by performing an image feature analysis.
              Those results are afterward passed to a common-sense reasoning
              system, which analyses, selects and corrects the initial
              estimation yielded by the machine learning algorithm. This second
              stage resorts to the knowledge implicit in the rationality that
              motivates human behaviour. Experiments are performed in realistic
              conditions, where poor recognition rates by the machine learning

                   and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and
                   cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was
                   trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In
                   this paper, we report on our investigation of an early
                   version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by
                   OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is
                   part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and
                   Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general
                   intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising
                   capabilities and implications of these models. We
                   demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can
                   solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics,
                   coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without
                   needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these
                   tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to
                   human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior
                   models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of
                   GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be
                   viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an
                   artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our
                   exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering
                   its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for
                   advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of
                   AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm
                   that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with
                   reflections on societal influences of the recent

              have commonsense, and therefore must be hard-coded with prior

              language models can already learn to capture certain common sense
              knowledge. Our key observation is that a language model can
              compute the probability of any statement, and this probability
              can be used to evaluate the truthfulness of that statement. On
              the Winograd Schema Challenge (Levesque et al., 2011), language
              models are 11\% higher in accuracy than previous state-of-the-art

              investigating commonsense knowledge contained in contextualized

  abstract      = "As AI systems become more advanced and widely deployed,
                   there will likely be increasing debate over whether AI
                   systems could have conscious experiences, desires, or other
                   states of potential moral significance. It is important to
                   inform these discussions with empirical evidence to the
                   extent possible. We argue that under the right
                   circumstances, self-reports, or an AI system's statements
                   about its own internal states, could provide an avenue for
                   investigating whether AI systems have states of moral
                   significance. Self-reports are the main way such states are
                   assessed in humans (``Are you in pain?''), but self-reports
                   from current systems like large language models are spurious
                   for many reasons (e.g. often just reflecting what humans
                   would say). To make self-reports more appropriate for this
                   purpose, we propose to train models to answer many kinds of
                   questions about themselves with known answers, while
                   avoiding or limiting training incentives that bias
                   self-reports. The hope of this approach is that models will
                   develop introspection-like capabilities, and that these
                   capabilities will generalize to questions about states of
                   moral significance. We then propose methods for assessing
                   the extent to which these techniques have succeeded:
                   evaluating self-report consistency across contexts and
                   between similar models, measuring the confidence and
                   resilience of models' self-reports, and using
                   interpretability to corroborate self-reports. We also
                   discuss challenges for our approach, from philosophical
                   difficulties in interpreting self-reports to technical
                   reasons why our proposal might fail. We hope our discussion
                   inspires philosophers and AI researchers to criticize and
                   improve our proposed methodology, as well as to run
                   experiments to test whether self-reports can be made

                   Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of

                   expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users,
                   especially if the individual models are large neural nets.
                   Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible
                   to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model

                   more explainable models. We analyze different choices to
                   collect knowledge-aligned dialogues, represent implicit
                   knowledge, and transition between knowledge and dialogues.

                   The task of detecting emotions in textual conversations
                   leads to a wide range of applications such as opinion mining
                   in social networks. However, enabling machines to analyze
                   emotions in conversations is challenging, partly because
                   humans often rely on the context and commonsense knowledge
                   to express emotions. In this paper, we address these
                   challenges by proposing a Knowledge-Enriched Transformer
                   (KET), where contextual utterances are interpreted using
                   hierarchical self-attention and external commonsense
                   knowledge is dynamically leveraged using a context-aware

                   Introduction: Recognizing the cause behind emotions in text
                   is a fundamental yet under-explored area of research in NLP.
                   Advances in this area hold the potential to improve
                   interpretability and performance in affect-based models.
                   Identifying emotion causes at the utterance level in
                   conversations is particularly challenging due to the
                   intermingling dynamics among the interlocutors. Method: We
                   introduce the task of Recognizing Emotion Cause in
                   CONversations with an accompanying dataset named RECCON,
                   containing over 1,000 dialogues and 10,000 utterance
                   cause-effect pairs. Furthermore, we define different cause
                   types based on the source of the causes, and establish
                   strong Transformer-based baselines to address two different
                   sub-tasks on this dataset: causal span extraction and causal
                   emotion entailment. Result: Our Transformer-based baselines,
                   which leverage contextual pre-trained embeddings, such as
                   RoBERTa, outperform the state-of-the-art emotion cause
                   extraction approaches Conclusion: We introduce a new task
                   highly relevant for (explainable) emotion-aware artificial
                   intelligence: recognizing emotion cause in conversations,

                   contexts from the relative past and future. However,
                   simultaneous incorporation of past and future contexts using
                   generative language models (LMs) can be challenging, as they
                   are trained either to condition only on the past context or

                   stands for Graph-enhanced Representations for Automatic

                   been relatively little research in support of abductive
                   natural language inference and generation. We present the
                   first study that investigates the viability of
                   language-based abductive reasoning. We introduce a challenge
                   dataset, ART, that consists of over 20k commonsense

               recent progresses on benchmarks may seem to suggest otherwise.
               In particular, the recent neural language models have reported
               above 90\% accuracy on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a
               commonsense benchmark originally designed to be unsolvable for
               statistical models that rely simply on word associations. This
               raises an important question---whether these models have truly
               acquired robust commonsense capabilities or they rely on
               spurious biases in the dataset that lead to an overestimation of
               the true capabilities of machine commonsense.To investigate this
               question, we introduce WinoGrande, a large-scale dataset of 44k
               problems, inspired by the original WSC, but adjusted to improve
               both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key steps of
               the dataset construction consist of (1) large-scale
               crowdsourcing, followed by (2) systematic bias reduction using a
               novel AFLITE algorithm that generalizes human-detectable word
               associations to machine-detectable embedding associations. Our
               experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve
               considerably lower accuracy (59.4\%-79.1\%) on WINOGRANDE
               compared to humans (94\%), confirming that the high performance
               on the original WSC was inflated by spurious biases in the
               dataset.Furthermore, we report new state-of-the-art results on
               five related benchmarks with emphasis on their dual
               implications. On the one hand, they demonstrate the
               effectiveness of WINOGRANDE when used as a resource for transfer
               learning. On the other hand, the high performance on all these
               benchmarks suggests the extent to which spurious biases are
               prevalent in all such datasets, which motivates further research

              (QASC), that requires retrieving facts from a large corpus and

              first dataset to offer two desirable properties: (a) the facts to
              be composed are annotated in a large corpus, and (b) the
              decomposition into these facts is not evident from the question
              itself. The latter makes retrieval challenging as the system must
              introduce new concepts or relations in order to discover
              potential decompositions. Further, the reasoning model must then
              learn to identify valid compositions of these retrieved facts
              using common-sense reasoning. To help address these challenges,
              we provide annotation for supporting facts as well as their

               Despite considerable advances in deep learning, AI continues to
               be narrow and brittle due to its lack of common sense. Why is
               common sense so trivial for humans but so hard for machines? In
               this essay, I map the twists and turns in recent research
               adventures toward commonsense AI. As we will see, the latest
               advances on common sense are riddled with new, potentially
               counterintuitive perspectives and questions. In particular, I
               discuss the significance of language for modeling intuitive
               reasoning, the fundamental limitations of logic formalisms
               despite their intellectual appeal, the case for on-the-fly
               generative reasoning through language, the continuum between
               knowledge and reasoning, and the blend between symbolic and
               neural knowledge representations.",

                   newly proposed ERC models have leveraged pre-trained
                   language models (PLMs) with the paradigm of pre-training and
                   fine-tuning to obtain good performance. However, these

  abstract      = "Multi-turn dialogue reading comprehension aims to teach
                   machines to read dialogue contexts and solve tasks such as
                   response selection and answering questions. The major
                   challenges involve noisy history contexts and especial
                   prerequisites of commonsense knowledge that is unseen in the
                   given material. Existing works mainly focus on context and
                   response matching approaches. This work thus makes the first
                   attempt to tackle the above two challenges by extracting
                   substantially important turns as pivot utterances and
                   utilizing external knowledge to enhance the representation
                   of context. We propose a pivot-oriented deep selection model
                   (PoDS) on top of the Transformer-based language models for
                   dialogue comprehension. In detail, our model first picks out
                   the pivot utterances from the conversation history according
                   to the semantic matching with the candidate response or
                   question, if any. Besides, knowledge items related to the
                   dialogue context are extracted from a knowledge graph as
                   external knowledge. Then, the pivot utterances and the
                   external knowledge are combined with a well-designed
                   mechanism for refining predictions. Experimental results on
                   four dialogue comprehension benchmark tasks show that our
                   proposed model achieves great improvements on baselines. A
                   series of empirical comparisons are conducted to show how

                   that inform our conduct, such as ``It is expected that you

                   incoherent viewpoints that erode a user's trust in the moral
                   integrity of the system. Moral deviations are difficult to
                   mitigate because moral judgments are not universal, and
                   there may be multiple competing judgments that apply to a
                   situation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a new
                   resource, not to authoritatively resolve moral ambiguities,

                   intuitions, values and moral judgments reflected in the

                   LMs for their temporal reasoning capabilities in dialogs by
                   introducing a new task and a crowd-sourced English challenge
                   set, TIMEDIAL. We formulate TIME-DIAL as a multiple-choice
                   cloze task with over 1.1K carefully curated dialogs.
                   Empirical results demonstrate that even the best performing
                   models struggle on this task compared to humans, with 23
                   absolute points of gap in accuracy. Furthermore, our
                   analysis reveals that the models fail to reason about dialog
                   context correctly; instead, they rely on shallow cues based
                   on existing temporal patterns in context, motivating future
                   research for modeling temporal concepts in text and robust
                   contextual reasoning about them. The dataset is publicly

                   Traditionally SLU does not utilize the dialogue history

  abstract      = "Documents exhibit sequential structure at multiple levels of
                   abstraction (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, sections). These
                   abstractions constitute a natural hierarchy for representing
                   the context in which to infer the meaning of words and
                   larger fragments of text. In this paper, we present CLSTM
                   (Contextual LSTM), an extension of the recurrent neural
                   network LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) model, where we
                   incorporate contextual features (e.g., topics) into the
                   model. We evaluate CLSTM on three specific NLP tasks: word
                   prediction, next sentence selection, and sentence topic
                   prediction. Results from experiments run on two corpora,
                   English documents in Wikipedia and a subset of articles from
                   a recent snapshot of English Google News, indicate that
                   using both words and topics as features improves performance
                   of the CLSTM models over baseline LSTM models for these
                   tasks. For example on the next sentence selection task, we
                   get relative accuracy improvements of 21\% for the Wikipedia
                   dataset and 18\% for the Google News dataset. This clearly
                   demonstrates the significant benefit of using context
                   appropriately in natural language (NL) tasks. This has
                   implications for a wide variety of NL applications like
                   question answering, sentence completion, paraphrase
                   generation, and next utterance prediction in dialog systems.",

                   a crucial step in conversational systems that has been
                   extensively studied as a supervised classification problem.
                   However, in practice, new intents emerge after deploying an
                   intent detection model. Thus, these models should seamlessly
                   adapt and classify utterances with both seen and unseen
                   intents -- unseen intents emerge after deployment and they
                   do not have training data. The few existing models that
                   target this setting rely heavily on the scarcely available
                   training data and overfit to seen intents data, resulting in
                   a bias to misclassify utterances with unseen intents into
                   seen ones. We propose RIDE: an intent detection model that
                   leverages commonsense knowledge in an unsupervised fashion
                   to overcome the issue of training data scarcity. RIDE
                   computes robust and generalizable relationship meta-features
                   that capture deep semantic relationships between utterances
                   and intent labels; these features are computed by
                   considering how the concepts in an utterance are linked to
                   those in an intent label via commonsense knowledge. Our
                   extensive experimental analysis on three widely-used intent
                   detection benchmarks shows that relationship meta-features
                   significantly increase the accuracy of detecting both seen
                   and unseen intents and that RIDE outperforms the

                   referenced by machine learning models for tackling new and
                   challenging tasks. At the same time, there remain questions
                   about the quality and coverage of these resources due to the
                   massive scale required to comprehensively encompass general
                   commonsense knowledge. In this work, we posit that manually
                   constructed CSKGs will never achieve the coverage necessary
                   to be applicable in all situations encountered by NLP
                   agents. Therefore, we propose a new evaluation framework for
                   testing the utility of KGs based on how effectively implicit
                   knowledge representations can be learned from them. With
                   this new goal, we propose ATOMIC 2020, a new CSKG of
                   general-purpose commonsense knowledge containing knowledge
                   that is not readily available in pretrained language models.

                   CSKGs, performing the first large-scale pairwise study of

                   generate accurate, representative knowledge for new, unseen
                   entities and events. Finally, through human evaluation, we

              commonsense knowledge have been designed and constructed over the
              past decades. Recently, the focus has been on large text-based
              sources, which facilitate easier integration with neural

              the expense of the semantics of the sources and their

              their relations. We consolidate these relations into 13 knowledge

              sources and to compute indications of their coverage, overlap,
              and gaps with respect to the knowledge dimensions. Moreover, we
              analyze the impact of each dimension on downstream reasoning

               core challenge to Artificial Intelligence since its inception.
               Impressive results in Natural Language Processing tasks,
               including in commonsense reasoning, have consistently been
               achieved with Transformer neural language models, even matching
               or surpassing human performance in some benchmarks. Recently,
               some of these advances have been called into question: so called
               data artifacts in the training data have been made evident as
               spurious correlations and shallow shortcuts that in some cases
               are leveraging these outstanding results. In this paper we seek
               to further pursue this analysis into the realm of commonsense
               related language processing tasks. We undertake a study on
               different prominent benchmarks that involve commonsense
               reasoning, along a number of key stress experiments, thus
               seeking to gain insight on whether the models are learning
               transferable generalizations intrinsic to the problem at stake

                   regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS).
                   However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the
                   network, which causes a massive computational overhead:
                   Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000
                   sentences requires about 50 million inference computations
                   (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it
                   unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for
                   unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we
                   present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the

                   Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), our approach
                   uses larger models to teach smaller models. A key difference
                   is that we distill knowledge symbolically-as text-in
                   addition to the neural model. We also distill only one
                   aspect-the commonsense of a general language model teacher,
                   allowing the student to be a different type, a commonsense
                   model. Altogether, we show that careful prompt engineering
                   and a separately trained critic model allow us to
                   selectively distill high-quality causal commonsense from
                   GPT-3, a general language model. Empirical results
                   demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored
                   commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our
                   automatically distilled variant in all three criteria:
                   quantity, quality, and diversity. In addition, it results in

                   to generate textual evidence via a language model; the other
                   generator aims to extract factual evidence (automatically
                   aligned text-triples) from a commonsense knowledge graph
                   after graph completion. Those evidences incorporate
                   contextual commonsense and serve as the additional inputs to
                   the model. Thereafter, we propose a deep contextual encoder
                   to extract semantic relationships among the paragraph,
                   question, option, and evidence. Finally, we employ a capsule
                   network to extract different linguistic units (word and
                   phrase) from the relations, and dynamically predict the
                   optimal option based on the extracted units. Experiments on
                   the CosmosQA dataset demonstrate that the proposed CEGI

                   commonsense reasoning system for conversational agents in an
                   attempt to achieve this. Our reasoner uncovers unstated

                   original entailment style. Following the previous work, we
                   further introduce the emotion information into graphs.
                   Emotion information can markedly promote the detection of
                   causal utterances whose emotion is the same as the targeted
                   utterance. However, it is still hard to detect causal
                   utterances with different emotions, especially neutral ones.
                   The reason is that models are limited in reasoning causal
                   clues and passing them between utterances. To alleviate this
                   problem, we introduce social commonsense knowledge (CSK) and

                   designing dialogue systems that direct a conversation toward
                   specific goals, such as creating non-obtrusive
                   recommendations or introducing new topics in the
                   conversation. In this paper, we introduce a new technique
                   for target-guided response generation, which first finds a
                   bridging path of commonsense knowledge concepts between the
                   source and the target, and then uses the identified bridging
                   path to generate transition responses. Additionally, we
                   propose techniques to re-purpose existing dialogue datasets
                   for target-guided generation. Experiments reveal that the
                   proposed techniques outperform various baselines on this
                   task. Finally, we observe that the existing automated
                   metrics for this task correlate poorly with human judgement
                   ratings. We propose a novel evaluation metric that we
                   demonstrate is more reliable for target-guided response
                   evaluation. Our work generally enables dialogue system
                   designers to exercise more control over the conversations
                   that their systems produce.",

                   structured triples from knowledge graphs and unstructured
                   texts from documents. To take both advantages of abundant
                   unstructured latent knowledge in the documents and the
                   information expansion capabilities of the structured
                   knowledge graph, this paper presents a new dialogue

              Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations",

  abstract = "Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) needs to detect the
              emotion of each utterance in conversations. However, it is
              difficult for machines to recognize the emotion of utterances
              like humans, partly because of the lack of commonsense knowledge.
              Despite existing efforts gradually incorporate knowledge in ERC,
              they can not adaptively adjust knowledge according to different
              utterances and their context. In this paper, we propose a
              knowledge selection framework SKSEC (Select Knowledge in light of
              Sentiment Emotion and Context). In the SKSEC framework, firstly,
              external knowledge is eliminated by three Knowledge Elimination
              (KE) modules. More concretely, In word-level KE, the concept
              knowledge different from the sentiment corresponding to the word
              in utterances is randomly eliminated. In utterance- or
              context-level KE, If the similarity between the knowledge
              representation and the emotion label representation of the
              current utterance or its context is less than the preset
              threshold, the knowledge will be eliminated. Then we refine the
              weight of knowledge using two Graph ATtention (GAT) mechanisms.
              Specifically, In Sentics GAT, we employ a dimensional emotion
              model to measure words in utterances and their corresponding
              knowledge and adjust the weight of knowledge according to their
              emotional similarity. In Semantics GAT, the weight of knowledge
              is adjusted according to the semantic similarity between context
              and incorporated knowledge. Finally, we feed the selected
              knowledge to the most advanced models to evaluate the quality of
              knowledge. The experimental results show that the SKSEC framework
              can effectively improve the performance of the model by
              eliminating and refining external knowledge in different size and

                   among persona sentences while synthesizing a dialog
                   response. Since such a choice is not observed in the data,
                   we model it using a discrete latent random variable and use
                   variational learning to sample from hundreds of persona
                   expansions. Our model outperforms competitive baselines on
                   the PersonaChat dataset in terms of dialog quality and
                   diversity while achieving persona-consistent and
                   controllable dialog generation.",

                   perform latent or explicit commonsense inference. Prior
                   commonsense reasoning benchmarks (such as SocialIQA and
                   CommonsenseQA) mainly focus on the discriminative task of
                   choosing the right answer from a set of candidates, and do
                   not involve interactive language generation as in dialogue.
                   Moreover, existing dialogue datasets do not explicitly focus
                   on exhibiting commonsense as a facet. In this paper, we
                   present an empirical study of commonsense in dialogue
                   response generation. We first auto-extract commonsensical
                   dialogues from existing dialogue datasets by leveraging
                   ConceptNet, a commonsense knowledge graph. Furthermore,
                   building on social contexts/situations in SocialIQA, we
                   collect a new dialogue dataset with 25K dialogues aimed at
                   exhibiting social commonsense in an interactive setting. We
                   evaluate response generation models trained using these
                   datasets and find that models trained on both extracted and
                   our collected data produce responses that consistently
                   exhibit more commonsense than baselines. Finally we propose
                   an approach for automatic evaluation of commonsense that
                   relies on features derived from ConceptNet and pre-trained
                   language and dialog models, and show reasonable correlation
                   with human evaluation of responses' commonsense quality. We
                   are releasing a subset of our collected data,

                   For machines to assist in information gathering, it is
                   therefore essential to enable them to answer conversational
                   questions. We introduce CoQA, a novel dataset for building
                   Conversational Question Answering systems. Our dataset
                   contains 127k questions with answers, obtained from 8k
                   conversations about text passages from seven diverse
                   domains. The questions are conversational, and the answers
                   are free-form text with their corresponding evidence

                   phenomena not present in existing reading comprehension
