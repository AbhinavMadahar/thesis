# Pre-Thesis Work

**Author: Abhinav Madahar**

Before I start graduate school, I should do some side projects to prepare for my thesis.
I want the projects to be in my intended field of focus, conversational agents.

My plan is to first read some theses in the field.
Doing so will demonstrate to me what I should reach in my own thesis.
From this, I will plan out at least one good side project, probably one which takes around four months to complete.
I will hopefully be able to do a few side projects before entering graduate school, which will give me a stronger grasp of the field.
The specific plan is detailed further in the TODO section.

I expect to work on my side project(s) casually on the side of my intended main position as a software engineer.
