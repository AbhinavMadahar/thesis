        The UCLA community acknowledges our presence on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Gabrielino/Tongva peoples.
        As a land grant institution, we pay our respects to the Honuukvetam~(Ancestors), 'Ahiihirom~(Elders), and 'Eyoohiinkem~(our relatives/relations) past, present, and emerging.

        The author of this work wanted to communicate this land acknowledgement in the Tongva language, but to his dismay this tongue has been lost to history.
        He wishes that, to the extent possible, that the Tongva retain an identity and sense of place despite this.
