    The UCLA community acknowledges our presence on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Gabrielino/Tongva peoples.
    As a land grant institution, we pay our respects to the Honuukvetam (Ancestors), 'Ahiihirom (Elders), and 'Eyoohiinkem (our relatives/relations) past, present and emerging.
