## Thesis proposal

I continued on (Kim et al, 2022).

Ok, I finally finished (Kim et al, 2022).
I'll acknowledge that I am a bit hazy on the significance of SICK++, but I did my best to explain the mechanics of how it works, ignoring the question of significance.
I did a good job of explaining the impact of SICK, which I hope is enough.

I decided to add content from (Richardson and Heck, 2023).

I decided to start using VSCode instead of Apostrophe to manage the outline.
It's just gotten so large and complex that Apostrophe can't manage it well.
VSCode isn't perfect, but it's better.
