- [ ] read section 4.4 of (Colon-Hernandez, 2023)
- [ ] read what a doctoral thesis proposal is and plan how to do it

---

I decided to start working on my thesis proposal.
Although I have not decided on the specifics, I know that I want to spend my thesis advancing commonsense reasoning in conversational agents.
I can write a partial thesis proposal on this and include it in my grad school applications.
It will also save me time when I am in grad school, putting me ahead of the curve.

I read:
- [an MIT article on what a doctoral thesis proposal is](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/phd-dissertation-proposal/), and
- [a Columbia article on the same](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/phd/requirements/proposal/).

The Columbia article also provides a LaTeX template for a proposal, which I intend to use with acknowledgement.
Brown also provides [a template](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/doctoral/proposal/brownthesis.cls).
I will decide which template to use later; I need to focus on the content first.
