## Thesis proposal

I now need to run my literature review for my thesis proposal.
The problem is that I'm not sure what to note for each paper I read.
Before I start reading papers, I need to answer this question.

Upon further thought, I have concluded that this is a nontrivial question.
I need to be prepared to spend a considerable amount of time answering this.
Fortunately, if I can answer this question, then reading those papers would become almost mechanical; I would just read them and fill out notes as needed.

Maybe I can set up my notes as questions to answer.
For example, I might ask for each paper:

- what does this introduce?
- how does it impact commonsense reasoning?
- etc.

If I were to use this technique, then I would need to establish these questions.
