# Statement of Purpose Outline

- Give a guide on how to evaluate my early thesis progress in the context of my application to graduate school
  - Note that all of my knowledge on commonsense reasoning has been autodidactical, so my strong understanding of the state of the field provides a substantial bull signal
    - Define bull and bear signals
    - If I've come this far without institutional support, imagine how far I could go under your tutelage
