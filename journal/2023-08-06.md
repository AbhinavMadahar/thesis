- [x] read section 4.3 of (Colon-Hernandez, 2023)
- [x] find material on prompting LLMs

---

I spent the last few days preparing my upcoming talk, Pedagogical Conversational Agents: Artificial Intelligence as a Tutor.
As such, I did not have enough time to work on my thesis.
After taking a short hiatus, I am back now, continuing where I left off.

I just finished reading section 4.3.1, which demonstrates how hinting can be used to guide the model towards making a particular inference.
This seems like an ability which can be useful for drawing an inferential chain.

After finishing section 4.3, I read the beginning of the Wikipedia article on LLM prompting.
I think that that's enough.
