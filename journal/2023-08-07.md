- [ ] read section 4.4 of (Colon-Hernandez, 2023)
- [ ] read what a doctoral thesis proposal is and plan how to do it

---

I decided to start working on my thesis proposal.
Although I have not decided on the specifics, I know that I want to spend my thesis advancing commonsense reasoning in conversational agents.
I can write a partial thesis proposal on this and include it in my grad school applications.
It will also save me time when I am in grad school, putting me ahead of the curve.

I read:
- [an MIT article on what a doctoral thesis proposal is](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/phd-dissertation-proposal/), and
- [a Columbia article on the same](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/phd/requirements/proposal/).

The Columbia article also provides a LaTeX template for a proposal, which I intend to use with acknowledgement.
Brown also provides [a template](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/doctoral/proposal/brownthesis.cls).
I will decide which template to use later; I need to focus on the content first.

From the MIT article:

> The Thesis Proposal should present a plausible argument for a specific approach to a well-defined problem, with the intention of making an original and significant contribution to knowledge in the field.

Specifically, it says to include the following sections:

1. Abstract,
2. Goals or problem statement,
3. Research question(s),
4. Background,
5. Research plan,
6. Expected results and contributions,
7. Timeline, and
8. Resources required.

The Columbia article recommends the same, adding that I should include at least one initial result which is publishable in a conference.
I am not sure if I will be able to include that, but it would be good if I can.

Among the sections needed, I will be best able to write the background, goals or problem statement, and research question(s) section. 
The research plan and the expect results and contributions will be harder to write because of how early I am in the process, but I can try to sketch a rough outline.
The timeline and resources required section are very simple, and I can make a rough outline of them.

As I read publications on conversational agents and commonsense reasoning in them, I should ask myself how to use the information in them to write my proposal. 
In particular, the background, goals or problem statement, and research question(s) sections will be informed by my readings.

[An article from Rochester](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html) includes the following questions to be considered while I conduct background work:

- What (if anything) has been done already?
- What has not been done?
- What are the major gaps in previous work?
- What are recognized “next steps”?

After answering those background questions, I should answer the following questions to form the basis of my research plan and goals:

- How the research will attack the problem,
- What it will not attack,
- How it will fit in with previous work, and
- What the essential contribution of the work will be.

Once I have that, I will focus on a timeline of and organisation of my research, answering:

- The specific research directions you will pursue in the immediate future
- The general research directions you will pursue in the more distant future
- The theme that will unify your research into a coherent PhD dissertation

I read a computer vision thesis proposal (Coombe, Greg. n.d. “Dissertation Proposal.” https://www.cs.unc.edu/~cssa/guides/proposals/coombe.pdf) as an example.
This particular proposal, published in 2005, seemed simple.
I will try to find a more recent proposal in my own field, conversational agents.

I added the NLP thesis proposal (White, Lyndon. n.d. “PhD Research Proposal.” Accessed August 7, 2023. https://www.oxinabox.net/publications/WhiteProposalSentenceVectors.pdf), which is more recent and closer in content to my proposal.
Also, because it is in NLP, I can understand its content, whereas the previous CV paper is all Greek to me.
