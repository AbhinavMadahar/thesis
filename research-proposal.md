## Education and experience

I did my undergraduate degree in computer science and mathematics.
As an undergrad, I was a research assistant under three professors, where I focused on machine learning and graph theory.
I also did several internships in data science.
Between undergrad and grad school, I was a software engineer at Academia.edu, where I did web development.
My CV details my experience further.

## The focus of my research

I intend to focus on conversational agents for my PhD thesis.
My eventual goal is artificial general intelligence, and I think that work in conversational agents is the most promising path towards it.

There are several subareas on which I am considering focusing, such as improving commonsense reasoning and reducing hallucinations.

## Timeline

I expect to spend the first three semesters of my PhD focusing on coursework, research taking a second priority.
After that, I will focus on research.

## Next steps

If you're available, I would like to schedule some time to talk, either in person or over Zoom.
