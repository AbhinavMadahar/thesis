- [ ] read chapter 3 of (Colon-Hernandez, 2023)
- [x] read _Does Sam Altman Know What He Is Creating?_ from The Atlantic

I found that section 3.1.1 explained prompting LLMs in general well, but confusingly explained the thesis' contribution of hinting.
It said that hinting will be explained in further detail in chapter 4, so I am not as concerned as I would be.
I have an incomplete understanding of hinting after reading 3.1.1, and I hope that I can expand it in chapter 4. 

Section 3.1.2 was rather short, acting mostly as an extension of 3.1.1.
I am interested in learning more about controllable text generation, which is not explored in this thesis.
Perhaps I can read some of the papers referenced in section 3.1.2.

I read the article _Does Sam Altman Know What He Is Creating?_ from The Atlantic.
I found that it was a beneficial expose to certain concepts which I should keep in mind in my work in artificial intelligence.
It focused almost exclusively on AIs which can conduct intellectual labour, not on AIs which are sentient.
Although the end goal of my research is machine sentience, an AGI would still be worthwhile.
