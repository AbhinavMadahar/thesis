## Thesis proposal

I realised that committing changes to the proposal based on finishing a paper does not make sense.
Doing so would be reasonable if I were to conceptualise writing my proposal as being the result of almost a simple concatenation of papers, but this is not the case.
I am writing my proposal and referencing papers, but the referencing of papers is subservient to the writing of the proposal.
As such, I should commit changes based on changes made to the proposal, not on the completion of any particular paper, though these two may coincide at times.

I also dropped that task which has appeared at the top for so long based on similar reasoning.
